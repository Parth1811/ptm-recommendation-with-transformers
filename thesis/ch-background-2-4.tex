\section{Approaches to Pre-Trained Model Recommendation}
\label{sec:approaches-ptm-recommendation}

Researchers have developed various methods to help software engineers identify the most
suitable PTMs, aiming to minimize fine-tuning and forward passes to reduce computational
costs. Section~\ref{sec:background-modelRecommendation} reviews state-of-the-art approaches for PTM
recommendations in downstream tasks, categorizing them into two main types: heuristic-
based and learning-based.
