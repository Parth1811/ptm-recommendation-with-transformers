First, to myself---for working hard, believing in myself, and showing the courage to leave the corporate world to pursue this master's degree. I did it.

To my parents---for your unwavering support and willingness to take risks with me, and for always encouraging me even when the path wasn't clear. Thank you for believing in this journey.

To my sister---for taking care of our parents in my absence and filling the hole I left behind. Your sacrifices didn't go unnoticed.

To Professor James Davis---for your bottomless wisdom and for showing me how a good researcher thinks and conducts themselves. Your guidance shaped not just this thesis, but how I approach problems.

To Huiyun Peng---for being the best support I could ask for at Purdue, my co-author, and friend. Pika pika!

To all my friends---it wouldn't have been possible to keep my sanity without your help. Thank you for the late-night conversations, the encouragement, and for reminding me there's life outside the lab.
